# Memory Consolidate Skill

Two-phase knowledge base cleanup: normalize verbose filenames, then consolidate semantic duplicates.

## When to Use

- **Long filenames**: When files have verbose 40+ character names that should be shortened
- **Duplicate topics**: When multiple files discuss the same topic with different wording
- **Post-migration cleanup**: After migrating to topic-based filenames (no date prefixes)
- **Knowledge base maintenance**: Periodic cleanup to keep notes organized

## Usage

```
/mem-consolidate
/mem-consolidate project:my-project
/mem-consolidate project:my-project dryRun:true
/mem-consolidate project:my-project normalizeOnly:true   # Skip duplicate merging
```

### Workflow Overview

```
Phase 1: Normalize Long Filenames
├── Find files with names > 40 chars
├── AI suggests short generic titles (2-4 words)
├── Rename files, add original as alias
└── Handle collisions (merge or suffix)

Phase 2: Consolidate Semantic Duplicates
├── AI groups notes by topic similarity
├── Merge groups into single files
├── Archive source files
└── Update aliases for future matching
```

## Workflow

### 0. Get Config (Required First Step)

Before any file operations, you MUST read the config:

1. **Read user config**: `~/.cc-obsidian-mem/config.json`
   - On Windows: `C:\Users\{username}\.cc-obsidian-mem\config.json`
   - On macOS/Linux: `~/.cc-obsidian-mem/config.json`

2. **Extract settings from config**:
   ```json
   {
     "vault": {
       "path": "/path/to/obsidian/vault",
       "memFolder": "_claude-mem"
     },
     "ai": {
       "enabled": true,
       "model": "sonnet",
       "timeout": 30000
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Construct project paths**:
   - Memory folder: `{vault.path}/{vault.memFolder}`
   - Projects folder: `{vault.path}/{vault.memFolder}/projects`
   - Project folder: `{vault.path}/{vault.memFolder}/projects/{project-name}`

4. **Note AI settings** for semantic matching:
   - `ai.enabled`: Whether to use AI (default: true)
   - `ai.model`: "sonnet", "haiku", or "opus" (default: sonnet)

**Important**: Never hardcode or assume vault paths. Always read from config first.

### 1. Detect Project

**Consolidation is always scoped to a single project.** Notes from different projects are never merged together.

- If no project specified, detect from current working directory (find `.git` root)
- If only one project exists in the vault, use it automatically
- If multiple projects exist and none detected, list them and ask the user to specify

### 2. Collect All Notes

For each category (decisions, patterns, errors, research, knowledge):

1. **List all files** in `{project}/{category}/` folder
   - **Exclude** category index files (e.g., `decisions/decisions.md`)
   - **Exclude** `.archive/` subfolder
   - **Exclude** sessions folder

2. **Build notes list** with title, category, and filename length:
   ```
   [
     { "title": "Stop hook non-blocking", "category": "decisions", "path": "...", "filenameLength": 24 },
     { "title": "QA: How to prevent stop hook from blocking", "category": "research", "path": "...", "filenameLength": 53 },
     ...
   ]
   ```

### 3. Normalize Long Filenames (Phase 1)

**Before finding duplicates**, normalize verbose filenames to short generic titles.

#### Step 3a: Identify Long Filenames

Find all files with filename length > 40 characters (excluding `.md` extension):

```
Long filenames found:
  1. [decisions] use-writeifchanged-pattern-to-avoid-unnecessary-fi.md (50 chars)
  2. [research] qa-how-to-prevent-stop-hook-from-blocking-claude-s.md (53 chars)
  3. [patterns] atomic-file-operations-with-collision-handling.md (47 chars)
```

#### Step 3b: AI Prompt for Title Normalization

Send long filenames to AI for generic title suggestions:

```
Suggest short generic titles (2-4 words) for these verbose filenames.

FILES:
0. [decisions] "use-writeifchanged-pattern-to-avoid-unnecessary-fi"
1. [research] "qa-how-to-prevent-stop-hook-from-blocking-claude-s"
2. [patterns] "atomic-file-operations-with-collision-handling"

Respond with JSON:
{"titles": ["WriteIfChanged pattern", "Stop hook blocking", "Atomic file operations"]}

Rules:
- Keep titles short: 2-4 words maximum
- Capture the core concept, not implementation details
- Remove prefixes like "qa-", "how-to-", "pattern-for-"
- Use title case
```

#### Step 3c: Rename Files

For each long filename:

1. **Rename file** to slugified generic title (e.g., `write-if-changed-pattern.md`)
2. **Update frontmatter title** to the generic title
3. **Add original verbose title as alias** for future Jaccard matching
4. **Update parent links** if needed

Example transformation:
```
Before: use-writeifchanged-pattern-to-avoid-unnecessary-fi.md
After:  write-if-changed-pattern.md
        aliases: ["use writeifchanged pattern to avoid unnecessary fi"]
```

#### Step 3d: Handle Collisions

If the generic filename already exists:
- **Check if semantically same topic** → merge into existing file
- **Different topic** → add suffix: `write-if-changed-pattern-2.md`

### 4. Find Duplicate Groups Using AI (Phase 2)

Use AI semantic matching to identify groups of notes **within the current project** that discuss the same topic.

#### AI Prompt for Grouping

Send this prompt to Claude CLI using the model from config:

```
Group these notes by semantic similarity (same topic, different wording).

NOTES (0-indexed):
0. [decisions] "Stop hook non-blocking"
1. [research] "QA: How to prevent stop hook from blocking"
2. [research] "QA: Stop hook blocking Claude session"
3. [patterns] "Two-phase locking"
...

Respond with JSON using 0-based indices:
{"groups": [[0,1,2], [3]], "genericTitles": ["Stop hook blocking", "Two-phase locking"]}

Rules:
- Only group notes that are semantically about the SAME topic
- Notes in different categories CAN be grouped if same topic
- Each note appears in at most one group
- Single-note groups can be omitted
- Suggest a short generic title (2-4 words) for each group
```

#### Execute AI Call

```bash
echo '<prompt>' | claude -p - --model {config.ai.model} --no-session-persistence --output-format text
```

#### Parse Response

AI returns groups like:
```json
{
  "groups": [[0,1,2], [5,8,12]],
  "genericTitles": ["Stop hook blocking", "Windows path normalization"]
}
```

### 5. Process Each Duplicate Group

For each group with 2+ notes:

#### Step 5a: Present Group to User

Show the group for confirmation (unless auto-mode):

```
Found duplicate group: "Stop hook blocking"
  1. [decisions] stop-hook-non-blocking.md
  2. [research] qa-how-to-prevent-stop-hook-from-blocking-claude-s.md
  3. [research] qa-stop-hook-blocking-claude-session.md

Merge into: decisions/stop-hook-blocking.md ?
[Yes / Skip / Custom target]
```

#### Step 5b: Execute Merge

1. **Choose target file**:
   - Prefer existing GENERIC filename (short, 1-4 words)
   - Or use AI-suggested generic title
   - Keep in the most appropriate category (decisions > patterns > errors > research)

2. **Merge content**:
   - Sort by `created` date (oldest first)
   - Combine as timestamped entries: `## Entry: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
   - Merge tags (unique union)
   - **Add all source titles as aliases** (for future Jaccard matching)
   - Update `entry_count`

3. **Write merged file** to target path

4. **Archive source files** (except target) to `.archive/`

### 6. Merge Workflow

When merging multiple files into one:

1. **Sort files** by created date (oldest first)
   - Read frontmatter `created` field (ISO8601 format)
   - Fallback: use file mtime if `created` missing

2. **Prepare merged content**:
   - Use oldest file's `created` date
   - Merge all tags (unique union)
   - Combine all aliases (unique, cap at 10)
   - Combine content with timestamped entry headers:
     ```markdown
     ## Entry: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
     {content from this file}
     ```
   - Calculate `entry_count` from all `## Entry` headers

3. **Write merged file**:
   - Use generic filename (shortest/most canonical)
   - Include aliases from all source files
   - If target file exists, append and merge frontmatter

4. **Archive source files** (except the target file):
   - Move to `.archive/` subfolder
   - Handle conflicts with timestamp suffix

### 7. Auto-Merge Mode

When user requests automatic merging (no prompts):

1. **Trust AI groupings**: Auto-merge all groups identified by AI
   - AI has already determined semantic similarity
   - Use AI-suggested generic titles

2. **Category priority for target**: When group spans categories:
   - decisions > patterns > errors > research > knowledge
   - Or keep in category with most files

3. **Still prompt for**:
   - Groups with notes in very different categories (e.g., errors + decisions)
   - When AI confidence indicators suggest uncertainty

### 8. Report Summary

After processing all files:

```markdown
# Consolidation Summary

**Scanned**: {N} files across {M} categories
**AI Model**: {config.ai.model}

## Phase 1: Filename Normalization
| Before | After | Category |
|--------|-------|----------|
| use-writeifchanged-pattern-to-avoid-unnecessary-fi.md | write-if-changed-pattern.md | decisions |
| qa-how-to-prevent-stop-hook-from-blocking-claude-s.md | stop-hook-blocking.md | research |

**Normalized**: {X} files renamed to shorter titles

## Phase 2: Duplicate Consolidation
| Group | Files | Target | Aliases Added |
|-------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Stop hook blocking | 3 | decisions/stop-hook-blocking.md | 2 |
| Windows path normalization | 4 | research/windows-path-normalization.md | 3 |

**Merged**: {Y} duplicate groups

## Skipped
- `{filename}`: {reason}

## Final Stats
- Files before: {N}
- Normalized: {X} long filenames → short titles
- Merged: {Y} duplicate groups
- Files after: {M}
- Total reduction: {N-M} files ({percentage}%)

---
Archived files are in `.archive/` folders.
Aliases added will improve future Jaccard matching.
```

## AI Semantic Matching Details

### Why AI Instead of Filename Patterns?

Filename-based matching (Jaccard word similarity) misses semantic duplicates:
- "stop-hook-non-blocking" vs "prevent-stop-hook-blocking" → different words, same topic
- "windows-config-location" vs "cc-obsidian-mem-config-path" → same topic
- "jaccard-similarity-limitations" vs "word-based-matching-insufficient" → same topic

AI understands that these are the same topic even with different wording.

### Self-Improving System

When AI identifies duplicates and they're merged:
1. **All source titles added as aliases** to merged note
2. **Next time**, Jaccard matching will catch similar titles (aliases are checked)
3. **Reduces future AI calls** - the system learns from consolidation

### Handling Large Note Collections

If project has many notes (50+), batch the AI call:
1. Send first 50 notes to AI
2. Process identified groups
3. Repeat with remaining notes
4. This avoids prompt size limits

## Edge Cases

### Category Index Exclusion

**Problem**: Category index files like `decisions/decisions.md` have the same slug as their folder name.

**Solution**: Explicitly exclude files matching `${category}.md` pattern.

### Sessions Folder

**Problem**: `sessions/` folder contains auto-generated session notes.

**Solution**: Exclude `sessions` category from consolidation.

### Files Without Created Date

**Problem**: Some files may not have `created` field in frontmatter.

**Solution**: Fall back to filesystem mtime and warn user.

### Already-Consolidated Files

**Problem**: Some generic files may already have multiple entries from previous consolidations.

**Solution**: Append new entries, merge aliases, update entry_count.

### Archive Conflicts

**Problem**: File already exists in `.archive/` from previous consolidation.

**Solution**: Append timestamp to filename: `auth-bug_20260115-103000.md`

## Safety Features

- **Dry run available**: Preview changes before applying
- **Archive before delete**: Old files moved to `.archive/` for easy recovery
- **Conflict handling**: Timestamp suffixes prevent overwrites
- **Alias preservation**: Original titles saved for future matching
- **Incremental**: Can run multiple times safely

## Follow-up Actions

After consolidation, suggest:
- Review archived files in `.archive/` folders
- Run `/mem-audit` to verify vault structure is clean
- Clean up old archives when confident changes are correct
